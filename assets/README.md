Here in the Garden, we like to play trivia games! ill pick something in the Garden
        and ask you a question, if you get two or more right answers, you win! 🌺🍃 
        but if you get two or more wrong, you loose 🥀🍂  dont worry, nothing TOO bad happens if you loose!
        take a deep breath, and do your best! good luck.
