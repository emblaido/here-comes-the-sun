alrighty boys lets go!
this is a lighthearted on the outside, but dark twist on the insdie triva game! think the fairy in "Labrinth" 

The user will be greated when they open the web page, 
there will be a score keeping section, and a start buttun and a restart button.

user will be shown the directions and asked if they are ready to start,
when they click start it will signel a promt.

that promt will present the user a question,
if the answer is wrong, the user will be informed and the  user will loose one count, the "incorrect"  number on the scare keeper will go down by one.

if the answer is correct the user will be shown a message, then a new promt with a new question will appear and the user will gain one count, and the "correct" count will increase by one in the score keeper, 

if the incorrect count goes down three times and reaches 0 on the score keeper, then the 
user looses the game! a message will appear and 
and the game will be over, no more promts will be given. and maybe the garden will set on fire? 

if the user gets ten right answers and the number on the scorekeeper reaches 5, then the user wins! a message will appear, the game will reset and no more promts will be given untill untill the user pushes start again
